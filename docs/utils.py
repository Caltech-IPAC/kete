"""
Utilities for running the tutorials.
Tutorials are expected to take significantly more time than standard code to run,
and as a result are only run infrequently.

This file provides a CLI tool to run the tutorials, it must be run from the base
of the docs folder.

To run all tutorials:
>>> python utils.py build *
