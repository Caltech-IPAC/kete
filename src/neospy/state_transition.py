def compute_stm(state: State, jd_end: float) -> NDArray:
    """
    Compute the 6x6 State Transition Matrix (STM) for the provided state to the target
    JD.

    The STM is computed using 2-body mechanics.

    This matrix may be used to compute the final state at the specified JD by
    multiplying the vectorized version of the state against the matrix. Note that
    this is far less efficient than using the two-body propagation code.

    There are two main practical uses for the STM:
        - To propagate covariance matrices which represent uncertainty to a new epoch.
        - To turn the orbit determination problem into a least squares optimization
          problem.

    Parameters
    ----------
    state:
        State of a single object.
    jd_end:
        Julian time (TDB) of the desired final state.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Returns the 6x6 state transition matrix.

    Given a 6x6 covariance matrix which represents uncertainty in [X, Y, Z, Vx, Vy, Vz],

    Parameters
    ----------
    state:

    covariance:
        A 6x6 covariance matrix with units of AU for distance and AU/Day for time.
