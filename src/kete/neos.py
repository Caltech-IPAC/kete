def sunshield_rotation(sun2obs, pointing):
    """
    Calculate the angle the field of view must be rotated around the pointing
    vector by in order to place the sun shield directly between the telescope
    and sun.

    The rotation is defined as the angle needed to move the sun shield from
    the Z-axis down to the angle required to place it between the
    sun and telescope. The angle is defined by the right hand rule applied
    along the pointing vector.

    Pointing vector must be at least about a half an arcsecond from the poles
    in order to be computable.

    Note that no coordinate frames are specified here, this provides the
    rotation in the current frame from the frame's Z-axis. Provided inputs
    are assumed to be from the matching frame.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sun2obs :
        The vector from the sun to the telescope, units are arbitrary.
    pointing :
        The vector along which the telescope is pointing, the spacecraft's
        Z-axis.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Angle in degrees around the pointing vector the spacecraft must be
        rotated to place the sun shield between the telescope and the sun.
